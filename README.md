# PyPassword Generator

This is a simple Python script that generates a random password based on user-defined criteria, including the number of letters, symbols, and numbers.

## Usage

1. Run the script:

```bash
python password_generator.py
```

2. Follow the prompts to customize your password:

   - Enter the number of letters you'd like in your password.
   - Specify the number of symbols you want.
   - Indicate how many numbers you'd like.

The script will then generate and display your random password.

## Example

```plaintext
Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!
How many letters would you like in your password? 8
How many symbols would you like? 2
How many numbers would you like? 3

Your password is: R$%hJ7pK2
```

## Note

- Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- The generated password will be a random combination of letters, symbols, and numbers.
